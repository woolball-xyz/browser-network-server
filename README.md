# WoolBall Browser Network Server

## How to use

### Prerequisites

Build and run the browser network server with docker compose.
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start an HTTP server on port 9002 and a WebSocket server on port 9003.

For both to be used, you need to run the browser node.
